    description: "An interactive, relative taxonomic abundance plot of species across submitted samples. There are several noteworth ui features available for you analysis. To the top left of this section is a toolbar for manipulating your viewport. The legend acts can be used to isolate species on the graph by double-clicking; subsequent single-clicks can be used to sub-group multiple traces. To return back to the default legend, double-click once again. Finally to the left of the plot is a selection menu for subsetting data based on a chosen taxonomic panel"
